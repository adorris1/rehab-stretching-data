  ## Note from the Authors
  
  Can you think of anything more important than the health of yourself and those you care about?  Your physical health impacts your quality of life and happiness.  With good health, you build a stronger you with more positive energy to bring to your relationships and community.  Being free from aches and pains isn’t a requirement for enjoying life, but it does make enjoying life a whole lot easier.
  
  We are excited that your commitment to your health and fitness goals includes using the second edition of REHAB GUIDE: Your Guide to Effective Exercise Rehabiliation and Stretching.  This book includes a collection of the most commonly prescribed stretches and exercises at our clinic as well as visuals demonstrating how to perform them correctly. Additionally, the “keys to success” and “common mistakes” sections serve as helpful reminders in replicating the stretches and exercises on your own. 
  
  It is important to note that there are many, many stretches and exercises as well as variations available. Those we chose to include in this book have proven effectiveness and are less likely to cause injury if performed incorrectly.  However, we welcome your feedback regarding the stretches and exercises you find most useful in the prevention, management and/or treatment of various musculoskeletal conditions.  Please send all comments, feedback, and suggestions to Info@DorrisChiropractic.com. Thanks again.
  
  In health,
